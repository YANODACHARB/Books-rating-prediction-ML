# Books-rating-prediction-ML
Books rating prediction from a CSV file

    #Project GOAL?
    
Using the "books.csv" dataset, we are going to train a model that predicts a book’s rating.
First, we should understand data, what are the important factors that make a book more intersting than another one.
To do that! This project going include differents parts, such:

1- Exploratory analysis, cleaning and visualisation of the data,

2- Data preprocessing, Feature engineering and selection,

3- Model training and evaluation,

4- Included Jupyter notebook Report


 
    #Repository contain :
    
This repository contain:
1- A CSV file -> 'Books.cvs' that contain our data. 
The dataset provided is a curation of Goodreads books based on real user information. It can be

11) publication_date: The date the book was published.
12) publisher: The name of the book publisher.

  
  2- IPYNB 'Books Machine Learning project' file that contain the code:
  Starting with a Data Exploration,Cleaning, Visualisation, Preprocessing and Machine Learning Model
  
  3- A 'requirements.txt' file that contain all dependencies needed to code.
